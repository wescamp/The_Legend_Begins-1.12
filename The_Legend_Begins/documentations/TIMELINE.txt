BW: Before Wesnoth
YW: Years Wesnoth

==Timeline of Irdya==

This is meant to be a list of the historical events of Irdya that took place before the Kingdom of Wesnoth was established as well as many events related to the Great Continent and Irdya. It is un-official but provides enough details for any curious UMC creator. 

===Locations===

====Great Continent====
This is Irdya's largest known continent buy, only a few parts of it had been explored.

=====The Sandy Wastes=====
This is a great desert that exists between Wesnoth and the Silver Lands. It is rumoured that the Khalifate, a faction of Haldric's people that were separated and compelled to adapt to the barren conditions, may reside in settlements here. However, there is no evidence of their existence.

=====The Silver Lands=====
The community lying to the East of Wesnoth is known as the Silver Lands. At its north, lies the southeastern part of the Lins-Elen (Lintair Forest) and the Eventide cities of Noct and Diurna, a volcano known as the Fire Cloud Peak that is home to the Silver Drakes and Ssyuriss Fen, a swamp home to the hynea-like Gnolls and a saurian tribe. The Bitter Swamp and the Sandy Wastes desert separate this region from Wesnoth. The Triththa Mountains lie at its heart and is the home of the Dwarves of Triththa. Lake Aoir lies to the South and the Minotaur country is situated around this lake.

Explorers say that this may be the eastern edge of the Great Continent, but no evidence has supported their stories...yet. 
 
=====Kingdom of Wesnoth=====

This is the most prominent kingdom in Irdya, almost associated with the entire western part of the Continent. Its capital is Weldyn located at the kingdom's eastern regions. It's most significant city is Dan'Tonk.

=====Elensefar=====

A lorddom near Wesnoth's western border. This city state is sometimes a part of Wesnoth or sometimes considered to be an independent region. Either way, it has been an ally of Wesnoth almost throughout its history.

=====The Northlands=====

=====The Far North=====

=====The Far South=====
The region that lies beyond the southern border of Wesnoth and Aethenwood is known as the Far South. There is no factual account of what actually exists there, but many adventurers who had opportunity to explore there state there is only a vast desert known as the Ashland Desert, which is actually a part of the Sandy Wastes.
----

====Arkenova====
A vast island, directly west from the Far North region of the Great Continent, and separated from the mainland by the Great Ocean. Considered by most explorers as a small continent, Arkenova has many geographical features that has attracted many adventurers and researchers since the time of its existence was made known. One notable feature is a mountain range that separates the majority of the continent from the eastern part.

'''The White Realm''' is another amazing region, located at the northwestern part and is a large area enchanted in an eternal winter; but due to a catastrophic war, known as '''The Great War''', that erupted throughout the continent, this region was reclaimed by the sea.

In the very heart of Arkenova, known as the Wild Lands, lies '''New Genesis''' - a human-dwarven city that is completely surrounded by a barrier of impervious mountains and is the home of the renowned adventurer and strategist, Jahin. To the east of New Genesis, lies the gateway to the former kingdom of the Vampires - who were driven away in the aftermath of the '''Great War'''.

The majority of the North and South of Arkenova are deserts, home to the drakes and elves respectively. There is also a vast forest, known as the Forest of Anuvien, to the southeast that is home to the wood elves and a thick swamp to the North that is the abode of the Saurians.

The minotaur city of '''Zetharon''' lies northwards from the Forest of Anuvien and southeastwards from New Genesis and is ruled by Rharcyn the Terrible. 
----

====Argea====

The actual name of the continent that is referred in Wesfolk lore as the Old Continent. It is smaller than the Great Continent but, no data has ever confirmed this. This land was where Haldric's people first originated. The human Empire of Anaktoran was a glorious empire, stretching from the eastern edge of the continent to the very heart of it. The western parts are orcish homelands and some Minotaurs are also seen in these regions. The Orcs reside in the hills, while the Minotaurs reside in the forests. It is not confirmed what lies at its northern shores but the southern one is the location of a vast forest. Not many things about this forest is known, save for the fact that it is rumoured to be the abode of many strange creatures - abominations and undeadlike begins. King Dowrein I, the first king ever to lead an expedition to the forest and survive its ordeal, names this forest the Forest of Nightmares.

====The Green Isle====
A large island lying somewhere on the Great Ocean, between the continents Argea and the Great Continent (Argh! Somebody please make a better name this!) and is thought to be the place where the Wose first came into existence (the evidence backing this up is very fragile and thus, could be ignored).

The central and southern area are home to the Islefolk (Halric's people) - refugees from Anaktoran who settled there, and over time these Islefolk settlements had developed into small cities such Southbay, Stormvale and Clearwater. Years later, the Wesfolk, led by Jevyan, arrive in the northern shores of the Green Isle and a lengthy war is fought between the two sides. The Islefolk prevail, pushing the Wesfolk to settle in small communities, although two of these settlements developed into cities, namely Jevyan's Haven and Blackmore.

The natives of the Green Isle are seldom encountered and are thought to reside in locations that were never explored before, namely the northern regions, excluding the location of Jevyan's Haven. The very few people who had crossed paths with these natives refer to them as a nobility. Despite the natives demonstrating themselves as a noble race, they remain as minor settlements who are at a fragile peace and wars are common between them. The natives have many fine sailors and their vessels, although very crude in design, are very fast. They also have a taste for herbal and fire magic and their skills with weapons such as swords and spears are somewhat fascinating. Centuries later, they were eventually called the Aragwaithi.

In the exodus of Haldric's people and the Wesfolk from the Green Isle, only the Aragwaithi remained there, since they were not willing to leave their homeland and most kingdoms went into hiding, to locations where the orcs would seldom look. A settlement of the Aragwaithi, however, was compelled to flee from the Green Isle and ended up arriving at the northeastern shores of Arkenova.

====Lands of the Icy North====
The northern most landmass of Irdya or in simple terms, the 'North Pole.' This region has long been the home of the Windsong Foundation but, the foundation's exact location is not specified.
