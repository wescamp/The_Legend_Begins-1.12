Its walls were of pure gold, its roads of pure silver, and its defenders were the best in Irdya, but we had many enemies: the strongest of which were the Woodlanders. They attacked us mercilessly. During one of their attacks, my wife was killed by an arrow through the chest and this was the point, where we decided to attack. We devastated their lands and fought to their leader and slew her. With her dying breath, she cursed me and my empire, transforming us to this state of undead. The city was engulfed by the earth and its walls and roads turned to earth and dust. This was just one of the effects of the curse. The other is that we have a craving for war and shall not stop until all life in this world has fallen before us. Thus, prepare to meet your deaths!"
