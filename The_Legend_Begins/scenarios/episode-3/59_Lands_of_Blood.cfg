Kojac sent his army under the command of Vigor Red-Tusk, an orc renowned for his unsurpassed strength as well as his helmet. In their ranks, included the usual orcs and goblins, as well as ogres, saurians and trolls. Jahin's army consisted of his soldiers and that of the dwarves. When everything had been made ready, the combined army of humans, dwarves, orcs, trolls, goblins, saurians and ogres left New Genesis and began the long march eastwards. Jahin left New Genesis guarded only by two battalions, thinking that all his enemies would be preoccupied with other matters."

The mage, Acromel, befriended the wose, Bregadol, when the vampires had first arrived in this land. Unbeknownst to Acromel, the vampire lord ordered the execution of all the woses. The woses were caught off guard and only Bregadol remained. Bregadol, seeing this treachery as some sort of betrayal by Acromel, went into a deep sleep. Acromel, when he heard about this, tried hard to apologise to his friend, but Bregadol would still not awaken. Finally, after a hundred years of apologising, Acromel killed himself."
